When you’re faced with troubling behaviour or stressful situations, you can engage in an inner dialogue that helps you define the problem you’re dealing with.

This way, you will get calm quicker and you will be able to respond in a more composed manner.

Here's how it works:

#1 Identify the Issue

The first step is to recognize and acknowledge what is happening.

Instead of “Why won’t they just stop?”, ask yourself questions like:

"Why is my child behaving this way?”

“What might be the underlying cause of their actions?

“Are they overwhelmed? Dysregulated? Do they need movement or connection?”

By understanding the root cause, you can address it effectively.

#2 Define the Situation

Once you've pinpointed the problem, clarify it in your mind.

You might tell yourself, "Okay, he is having a meltdown because we’ve been out for a couple of hours now. He is probably hungry and tired. Once we get home, things will settle down.”

#3 Recognize External Factors

Sometimes, it's not just your child's behaviour that contributes to your stress.

External factors, such as a busy schedule or many responsibilities, can also play a big role (especially if you’re a parent with ADHD).

Try to recognize those external pressures and say to yourself, "I've got a mountain of chores waiting at home, and that's putting me on edge."

Okay, now…

Let’s say your child is throwing a tantrum in the middle of a grocery store.

Instead of reacting in frustration, you take a moment to talk to yourself.

Identify the issue: your child skipped their afternoon nap, and they're exhausted.

Define the situation: a tired child is more likely to act out, and you understand that.

Recognize external factors: your stressful day at work could also contribute to your short fuse.

With this newfound awareness, you can respond differently.

You calmly reassure your child and make a plan to ensure they get some rest as soon as you get home.

You also remind yourself that your stress isn't your child's fault, and you need to manage it separately.

By having this thoughtful conversation with yourself, you can gain a better understanding of your feelings and reactions. It will allow you to stay composed, respond more calmly, and be the best parent you can be.
