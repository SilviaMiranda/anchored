 
There’s a specific kind of silence that falls across the room when a child is asked to do something that, to you, seems simple, and instead of responding, they go still.

Their shoulders slump. Their gaze falls somewhere between the wall and the floor. They sigh, or they groan, or they mutter “I can’t” even though you’ve seen them do this very thing before.

You wait, gently encourage, only to find that the more you engage, the deeper they seem to retreat, until eventually, it feels like you’re speaking into a void.

And all you’re left with is a vague sense of irritation and a growing fear that you’re raising someone who gives up at the first sign of difficulty.

It’s infuriating, isn’t it? And confusing, too. But the truth is, many children who shut down quickly in the face of effort aren’t being willfully oppositional or helpless.

They are trying, in the only way they know how, to escape the internal storm that gets triggered the moment a task feels even slightly out of reach. 🌀

What you're witnessing at that moment isn't exactly laziness. It's something closer to grief - a belief that they are not capable, and that trying will only confirm it.

We tend to assume that children are blank slates who will approach every task with the same sense of neutral curiosity.

But by the time a child reaches the age where school and social life introduce more complexity, most have already absorbed a set of stories about themselves.

And if those stories have been colored by failure, embarrassment, repeated correction, or the subtle but persistent feeling of not quite measuring up, then “I can’t” becomes a shield. 🛡️

It is, in many ways, a form of self-protection. Because if you don’t try, you can’t fail, right?
And if you shut down early, you get to control the narrative: “This wasn’t worth doing,” instead of “I wasn’t good enough to do it.”

And this is where most parents, with the best of intentions, push in exactly the wrong direction.

We push for effort. We push for compliance. We say things like, “You won’t know unless you try,” or “It doesn’t have to be perfect,” or “Just start, what’s so hard about that?”

But when a child’s shutdown is rooted in fear or shame, these words don’t sound like encouragement, but as pressure. And pressure only deepens the retreat.

So if you want to support a child who shuts down when something feels hard, the first step is recognize what that behavior is trying to avoid:

Instead of interpreting “I can’t” as resistance, consider it a signal that your child is overwhelmed - not necessarily by the task itself, but by the fear of looking incompetent.

And rather than focusing on getting them to do the thing, focus on helping them feel safe enough to begin.

This might look like breaking the task into steps so small they’re almost laughable. You can say something like, “Let’s just write the first word.”

It might sound like, “Would it help if I sat with you for the first few minutes?” or “Let’s get started together, and then I’ll step away when you’re ready,”

And this approach definitely includes changing the story you celebrate.

If the only time your child hears praise is when something is done, and done well, then you’re reinforcing the idea that effort only matters when it leads to success.

Instead, notice and name the moment they begin, especially if it’s shaky. Say, “You came back to it after walking away. That took courage.”

❌ Where many parents go wrong is by underestimating how much vulnerability it takes for a child who’s used to avoiding effort to choose engagement instead.

We want them to build grit. We want them to toughen up.

But grit doesn’t grow in a field of criticism. It grows in an environment where failure is allowed to happen without consequence to love, to connection, or to belonging.

That doesn’t happen in a single conversation, or a single moment of praise. It happens over time, as your child begins to realize that it’s not the result that earns your approval…

It’s the courage to begin again, even when it feels like they might fail.
