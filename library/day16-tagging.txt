 
If you want your child to focus on you right away, you can employ the Tagging System to get their immediate attention.

It will come in handy when you’re in a hurry, and you want your kids to cooperate quickly and without a fuss - so they simply do what you need them to do.

Now, before I share the system with you, there’s one thing we should agree on: You should use this system sparingly (just like the “STOP!” order for when your kids are in danger).

Use it only in the case of an emergency, when you absolutely need to.

The system has two parts:

1. Tag: The tag immediately tells your child what you need from them, in a single word. This will help you avoid all the confusion.

2. Instruction: Clear, simple instructions with what you need them to do. No over-explanations or repeating yourself - just say what you want, without complicating, in as short a way as possible.

I suggest you start with the following tags:

URGENT: When something is really urgent, and you need your kids to do something right away, not in 5 minutes.

IMPORTANT: When you really need your kids to listen and understand what you’re about to say.

HELP: When you need their immediate help with something that you can’t manage yourself due to physical limitations or other ongoing tasks.

Children with ADHD struggle with prioritizing what to pay attention to. These verbal “tags” cut through the noise and tell their brain: THIS matters right now.

Now, as I said before, don’t overuse these.

If everything is tagged as URGENT, children with ADHD will stop trusting the urgency signal altogether. Their brain learns what you really mean by how you use your words.

As a rule of thumb, I would use each of these tags at most once a week (or a handful of times per month, when you really need them the most).

You can also make a visual “Tag Chart” with the three tags, color-coded, and teach your child what each one means. This visual reference helps them recall it faster in real situations.

Now, here are some examples of how you can use these tags:

Example #1 - URGENT

Your grandma is in town and she just called you that she’s coming to visit in 5 minutes. There’s trash in the hallway that needs to be taken out. But since you’re preparing a risotto for lunch, you can’t handle this task by yourself.

In this case, you can use your tag:

“Mia, URGENT! Please take out the trash from the hallway because Grandma is coming to stop by in 5 minutes.”

If this situation was 20 minutes before Grandma’s arrival, you could also use the tag “HELP” instead.

Example #2 - HELP

You’re at the bus stop and realise you forgot to buy the bus tickets. Fortunately, the bus driver kindly agreed to wait for a few minutes while you sort it out. Knowing it will be quicker without your kids with you, you ask your older child for help.

“Tim, HELP! Take your brother’s hand and wait for me at this exact spot, please. I’ll be back in 5 minutes.”

Example #3: IMPORTANT

You just picked up the kids from their football practice, and you’re in a rush to get to the school office hours. On the way, you need to pick up your husband.

“Andy, IMPORTANT! Call your dad and tell him we’re going to pick him up in 10 minutes.”

Ok, that’s it!
