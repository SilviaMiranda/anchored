When your ADHD child is having a meltdown, tantrum, or complete emotional overwhelm...

It's because their nervous system is dysregulated, and they need something specific from you.

What they don't need is yelling, lectures, or consequences - these will only make the meltdown worse and last longer.

For children with ADHD, meltdowns often happen because their brain is overwhelmed, overstimulated, or missing basic physical needs. Their emotional regulation system is still developing, which means they need your calm, systematic support to get back to baseline.

So today, you'll learn the "Stop Losing Your Sh*T"Protocol - a step-by-step system to handle any meltdown without losing your cool, while addressing the root causes that trigger ADHD emotional explosions.

The Protocol: FUEL → FEEL → FUNCTION

Step #1: FUEL Check (Address Physical Needs First)
Before trying to talk or reason with your child, do an immediate FUEL Check. Most ADHD meltdowns have a physical trigger that's easy to fix once you know what to look for.

The 4-Point FUEL Check:

F = Food (when did they last eat (protein)?)

U = Urgency (do they need the bathroom?)

E = Energy (are they overstimulated or under-stimulated?)

L = Liquid (are they dehydrated?)

Quick FUEL Fixes:

Protein bite: Keep easy protein snacks handy (string cheese, nuts, protein bar). ADHD brains run on steady fuel.

Water check: Offer water immediately. Dehydration makes emotional regulation nearly impossible.

Sensory adjustment: Dim lights, reduce noise, or offer a weighted blanket if overstimulated. If understimulated, try jumping jacks or a quick walk.

Bathroom break: Don't ask if they need to go - just say "Let's take a quick bathroom break."

Step #2: FEEL (Emotional Validation and Regulation)
Once basic needs are met, help them identify and process what they're feeling.

Start with physical presence:

Get down to their eye level

Use a calm, quiet voice (remember Quiet Speech from Day 1)

Offer physical comfort if they want it (hug, hand on shoulder, or just sitting nearby)

Then, validate without fixing:

"I can see you're having big feelings right now."

"Your body looks really upset. That makes sense."

"It's okay to feel angry/sad/frustrated. Those feelings are allowed here."

Help them name it:

"What's happening in your body right now?"

"Is this a mad feeling, a sad feeling, or a scared feeling?"

"Show me with your hands how big this feeling is."

ADHD kids often struggle to identify emotions because their brains are moving so fast. Slowing down to name feelings helps activate their prefrontal cortex and starts the calming process.

Step #3: FUNCTION (Problem-Solving and Prevention)
Only after they're physically regulated and emotionally validated can you work on solutions.

Engage their thinking brain:

"Now that we've taken care of your body, what do you think your brain needs?"

"What usually helps you feel better when you're upset like this?"

"Do you want to try one of our calm-down activities, or do you have a different idea?"

Offer concrete body-based options:

Movement: Wall push-ups, jumping on a trampoline, dancing to one song

Pressure: Tight hug, weighted blanket, squeezing a stress ball

Breathing: Box breathing while counting on fingers, blowing bubbles

Sensory: Ice cube to hold, textured fidget, listening to calming music

Track patterns with a Trigger Log: After each meltdown, quickly note in your phone or a notebook:

Time of day

FUEL status (hungry/tired/overstimulated/etc.)

What was happening right before

What helped them calm down

How long did it last

This log will help you spot patterns and prevent meltdowns before they start.

For example, you might notice your child always melts down at 4 pm (blood sugar crash) or after school (sensory overload).

Ok, that’s it for today, let’s get some practice in.

Next time your child with ADHD experiences a tantrum or a meltdown:

Create a FUEL Kit: Gather protein snacks, a  water bottle, and 2-3 sensory tools your child likes

Practice the protocol: Use FUEL → FEEL → FUNCTION the next time your child is upset

Start your Trigger Log: Even just tracking for one week will reveal helpful patterns

Remember: The goal isn't to eliminate all meltdowns (they're part of ADHD), but to handle them without losing your cool and help your child develop self-regulation skills.

Most importantly, this protocol works because you're addressing the real, physical causes of ADHD emotional dysregulation instead of trying to reason with an overwhelmed nervous system.
