 
If you want your child to listen to you, cooperate with you, and respect you, you have to listen to them and respect them first.

That’s why you have to start practising talking WITH each other, not talking OVER each other.

You may think that you already listen to your child…

However, at times, our fears and concerns unintentionally creep into the discussion, making it difficult for them to have a say in the conversation.

From their perspective, it can feel like you're trying to lay down the law, not be the trusted partner they need.

So, when your child starts talking to you, listen attentively until they're done.

And then, when they’re done…

…wait an additional 20 seconds to see if they have anything more to add.

This pause is extremely helpful for children with ADHD, who often need extra time to organize their thoughts and find their words.

And if your kid asks, "Aren't you going to say anything?"

Well, that’s the sign that you've waited long enough.

This allows your child to share everything that's on their mind and ensures they truly feel heard.

Here’s how you can practise.

Let’s say your kid comes home from school.

You can start by asking them: “So, did anything fun happen today?”

"Yeah, Timmy tripped over his shoelaces during recess, and everyone burst into laughter.”

Instead of leaping in with immediate commentary or questions, wait 20 seconds.

You might receive a puzzled look or a question like, "Why are you being so weird? Is something wrong?"

"No, nothing's wrong at all. I was just really interested in hearing about your day. You mentioned Timmy tripping over his shoelaces during recess, and everyone laughing. How did Timmy react to that?"

This is how you let your child know that their words matter and that they are valued.

For ADHD kids, feeling truly heard helps build trust and reduces their instinct to “talk over” or interrupt you, which often comes from fear they won’t be allowed to finish.

And if your child gets easily distracted while talking, you can help them stay present by offering a small fidget, drawing together, or sitting back-to-back.

This can make it easier for them to speak without the pressure of constant eye contact.

By practising this approach, you will:

Set an example of good communication and encourage your child to do the same.

Create a good environment for open discussions, problem-solving, and constructive conversations.

Respect your child's thoughts and feelings.

Believe me, your child will appreciate your efforts and listen to you more attentively in return.
