Whenever you get overwhelmed by powerful emotions like anger, you have 3 options:

Act on them: If you’re angry, you yell or hit something. Not the best idea if you want to raise your kids in a calm, peaceful way.

Suppress them: Not a great idea as they’ll build up in you and you’ll blow up over time, with the possibility of resenting your family members.

Verbalize them: The best option as it allows you to get back in control, acknowledge your emotions and regulate them in a healthy way (and teach your child how to do the same).

I won’t lie to you.

Over the past 40 years, the kids that I worked with made me angry many, many times.

But in those moments, I didn’t hide my anger, nor did I yell because of it.

Instead, I expressed it in a calm, peaceful, but firm way.

I would say something like:

“I want to let you know that I’m angry at you right now. I won’t yell at you, but I am angry, and we will have to resolve this situation calmly.”

This lets the kids know how you feel, it lets them see that feeling powerful emotions is okay, and also teaches them that it’s possible to not get overwhelmed by them.

This is a valuable lesson for children with ADHD, showing them that even intense emotions don’t have to result in shouting or shutting down.

Then, once you’ve remained in control, you can either go to the Quiet Sofa (if you need to calm down further) or use the appropriate ADHD No-Yelling Tool.

Bonus tip: You can also write your go-to phrases, like “I’m feeling angry but I’m not going to yell,” on sticky notes or keep them in your phone for quick access. Scripts like this help reduce impulsive reactions.
