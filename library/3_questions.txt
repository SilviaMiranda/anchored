 
Yesterday, I asked you to think about whether your child could manage on their own for a couple of hours…

And based on the responses I've been getting, a lot of you are realizing something important.

This pattern of constant questions and relying on you is much bigger than you thought.

And here's what I think is happening…

This pattern has probably always been there, you're just noticing it more now because instead of dealing with it for a few hours in the evening after school, you're dealing with it all day long.

During the school year, you're still doing most of the same things…

You're probably reminding them about homework…

Settling their arguments with siblings…

Helping them wake up in the morning…

And stepping in when they get frustrated with tasks (that they probably could have handled themselves).

So if you think about it…

It makes complete sense that now that you're together most of the time, they don't bother to work through figuring something out when they could just ask you.

This isn't about them being lazy or you being too helpful…

It's just the natural path of least resistance when your help is constantly available.

But here's an interesting exercise you can start doing if you want to shift this dynamic…

And it starts with one simple realization:

When your child asks you a question, they're either asking because they genuinely can't figure it out or because they don't want to put in the effort to think it through.

And once you know which one it is, how you respond becomes pretty clear.

The problem is that at the moment, it's not always obvious which one you're dealing with.

So the next time your child asks you something, before you automatically jump in with an answer, ask yourself these three questions:

Do they have what they need to figure this out? (Are their art supplies accessible? Can they reach their clothes?)

Have I taught them how to handle this before? (Have we talked about what to do when bored?)

Have I seen them successfully do similar things? (Do I know they can pick out their own clothes?)

If you answered YES to all of them, then your child doesn't want to think through something they're perfectly capable of handling.

In that case, don't give them the answer.

If you answered NO to any of those questions, then your child genuinely can't handle this yet.

In that case, help them learn what they need to know.

It's that simple.

The reason this matters is because every time you answer a question your child could have figured out themselves…

You're training them to stop thinking and just ask you instead.

And while this three-question framework gives you a starting point, I've been working on something that makes building real independence much easier and more automatic.


# 3 pieces of independence puzzle
Okay, so yesterday's questions helped you figure out whether your child genuinely needs help or is just avoiding the effort.

But now what?

Because just knowing the difference doesn't automatically give you a clear plan for what to do about it.

What you need are practical ways to help your child build the skills and confidence to handle things independently…

Without you having to constantly remind, manage, or step in every time they hit a small obstacle.

And as I was going through all the resources I've created over the years, I realized something…

I had different pieces of the independence puzzle scattered across various programs.

So I decided to bring together the three most important ones that tackle this problem from every angle:

#1 Building Independence Through Daily Routines

One of the biggest reasons kids constantly need help isn't because they're trying to avoid work.

It's because they genuinely don't know how to do things completely and systematically.

They'll start getting dressed but forget half their clothes…

Clean their room but leave it still messy because they don't actually know what "clean"means…

Or brush their teeth for 10 seconds because no one ever taught them the proper routine.

And if you're constantly stepping in to finish what they started or remind them of the steps they missed, you're not teaching them how to think through a task from beginning to end.

That’s why the first resource gives you a complete system for teaching kids to manage their daily responsibilities independently, using clear, step-by-step approaches that eliminate the guesswork and build real competence.

#2 Developing Internal Motivation

The second challenge is that many kids have learned to wait around for someone else to tell them what to do.

They sit on the couch saying they're bored instead of finding something to engage with…

They wait for you to prompt them to start their homework instead of noticing it needs to be done…

They need constant direction to begin any task or activity.

This isn't about laziness…

It's about never developing the internal drive to notice what needs doing and take action on their own.

The second resource walks you through a process that systematically builds your child's internal motivation and initiative, so they start looking for things to do instead of waiting to be directed.

#3 Developing Bulletproof Work Habits and Follow-Through

The third piece is what happens when kids start something but don't finish it.

They begin cleaning their room but abandon it halfway through when they get distracted…

They start a project but quit the moment they hit any obstacle or frustration…

Or they need someone else to keep them motivated and on track to actually complete what they begin.

Real independence means they can stick with something even when it gets boring or challenging…

And see it through without needing your supervision or encouragement.

That's why the third resource focuses specifically on developing the kind of persistence and problem-solving skills that transfer to everything they do.

I've realized that these three components work together in a way that creates something much more powerful than any single approach could achieve on its own.

Because when kids have the competence to handle daily tasks…

The internal motivation to take initiative…

And the self-reliance to problem-solve independently…

They don't just become more helpful around the house…

They develop the problem-solving abilities and work ethic they'll need for everything from school assignments to managing their time in high school to handling college and career challenges.

For the first time, I'm making this complete approach available to parents who want to build these lifelong skills with their kids.
