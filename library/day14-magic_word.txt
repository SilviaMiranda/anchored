There will be times when you feel like you’re starting to “lose it” (or you already lost it) and you aren’t able to get yourself to do a do-over.

In those cases, the best way to de-escalate the situation is to use a Magic Word.

Magic Word works in the same way as a “time out” in sports.

For a period of time, until both sides have calmed down, you’re calling a “truce”.

This means that while you might disagree with your kids… You agree to disagree.

But just because you disagree on something, that doesn’t mean you have to fight about it. And it doesn’t mean that the disagreement needs to influence the rest of your day and put everyone in a bad mood.

You can wait until your emotions cool down, and then resolve the situation and its root cause in a calm manner.

The Magic Word can be “Truce” or “Time Out”, or something funny, like “Banana”. You can even ask your kids to come up with a name for it.

A silly Magic Word can break emotional tension fast, because humor activates the part of the brain that shuts off fight-or-flight mode.

It’s important that when you use the Magic Word, you move on with your day as planned. Your kids should still get their bedtime story or be able to go to the cinema.

There should be no immediate Logical Consequences - those might come once the situation is resolved.

One thing that works well when using the Magic Word is to move to a different location (“leave the crime scene”).

Go to the kitchen, grab a glass of water, and pour a glass of water to your kids. Get something to eat.

Then, move on with your day.

Whenever you use the Magic Word, make sure you close the loop you opened by leaving a disagreement unfinished.

It’s best to wait until the next day, and to talk about what happened when everyone is in a good mood. You can make a reminder for yourself to make sure you don’t forget.

It’s also best to do this while your kids are moving or have their hands occupied - when working on a puzzle, going for a walk, or taking the dishes out of the dishwasher.

Kids with ADHD often process emotions better when they’re doing something with their hands.

You can start the conversation by saying something like “Hey, I know we had a disagreement yesterday, and that I didn’t act the way I wanted to. I’m sorry for that. But it’s not good to leave situations like this unresolved. I’d like to talk about it and find a good solution together.”

If your kids resist or react to you emotionally, then let it go, and try again the next day. The key is to not push it, but to be consistent. Sooner or later, they’ll be willing to cooperate when they see you mean them no harm.

Because you’ve taken the time to calm down, the conversation will go way smoother than it would in the heat of the moment. Perhaps you have already come up with a new perspective or a new solution since your battle.

But most importantly, you didn’t let the situation get out of hand in the first place, because you used the Magic Word - and you are teaching your kids how to resolve disagreements calmly.

If you have multiple kids, you can also teach them this technique to reduce sibling battles.

Once they learn how to “agree to disagree” and move on with their days, there will be fewer sibling battles in your home.

Ok, now let’s take action:

The first thing you should do is decide on a Magic Word. You can ask your kids for help with this one.

Then, brief your kids on what the Magic Word is and how you want to use it. They can use it, too, of course. Say something like “Hey, so I know we’ve been arguing a lot lately, and I want to try something new. I’d like us to come up with a Magic Word that we can use as a truce when we disagree on something, so we don’t fight about it. What do you think a good word would be? It can be something funny, anything you choose.”.

Then, the next time you can’t take it anymore, use the Magic Word. You can even make a visual “Magic Word” card with the word and a silly drawing. Kids with ADHD often respond well to visual cues that interrupt their emotional flood.

Make sure you use the Magic Word sparingly. If you overuse it (i.e, use it every day), it will lose its “magic” and effectiveness. You should also use other ADHD No-Yelling Tools first whenever possible.

Depending on how often you find yourself yelling, I would use the Magic Word at a maximum of 1-2x/week, and ideally, only 1-2x/month or less.

Now go on, create your Magic Word and try it out in practice.
