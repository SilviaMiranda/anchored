 
Most parents think their kid is “addicted to screen time.”

I disagree.

Addiction isn’t the right word, at least, not yet. Addiction implies pleasure. Fun. Choosing something because it feels good.

What I see isn’t joy. It’s need.

Your child isn’t glued to the screen because they love it. They’re glued because they can’t face the alternative: silence, boredom, stress, loneliness. The screen isn’t their hobby. It’s their escape hatch.

And if that makes your stomach twist a little, it should.

Because when a child learns to escape instead of cope, you don’t just have a screen problem, you have a nervous system problem.

Let me say this bluntly - if the only place your child knows how to relax is inside a YouTube algorithm, you are handing their emotional life over to strangers who profit from keeping them restless.

It’s not the hours that scare me. It’s the dependency.

The way their body needs that dopamine drip just to come down from the day.

The way they can’t sleep unless a device has numbed them first.

The way their mood collapses the moment the screen turns dark.

That isn’t entertainment, that’s sedation.

And I know for a fact that we all understand it, because we’ve lived it too. We know how powerful this is, but we also know the crash that follows.

Now imagine that same cycle inside a 10-year-old who doesn’t have the language, the perspective, or the maturity to recognize what’s happening.

They just know that the screen feels easier than life, and so life slowly becomes unlivable without it.

✋ So here’s the shift: stop asking, “How much screen time is too much?”
That question is useless.

✅ Instead, ask: “What is my child trying to escape from?”

Because if you don’t name the thing underneath, you’ll keep treating the symptom, not the cause.

If school is crushing them, the screen becomes anesthesia.

If friendships are messy, the screen becomes the buffer.

If home feels chaotic, the screen becomes the one predictable refuge.

And the longer that goes unaddressed, the deeper the dependency.

So what can you do?

Not another lecture. Not another app timer. Not another angry confiscation that ends in slammed doors and tears.

Instead, start building parallel escapes that actually restore.

That could mean going for a walk after dinner and letting them rant without correcting them.

Or putting them in charge of cooking a side dish, something with their hands, something that ends with pride.

Or giving them 10 minutes of music, lying flat on the floor, eyes closed, letting their body calm down without needing pixels.

None of these are glamorous. None look revolutionary. But that’s the point. The nervous system doesn’t need fireworks, it needs rhythm, repetition, and safety.

Where most parents fail (and I’ve done this too) is by making the battle about the device.

We say, “Enough screen time!” We fight over hours, minutes, rules. We think discipline is the fix.

But discipline without replacement is just deprivation.

You can take the screen away, but if you don’t give them another way to self-soothe, they’ll come back harder, angrier, more dependent.

So tonight, don’t count minutes; watch behavior.

When your child disappears into a screen, don’t just yank them out. Ask yourself: what’s the pain they’re numbing?

Then, gently, persistently, imperfectly, offer them a different kind of medicine.

Because when they learn that their stress can be carried in ways that don’t involve endless scrolling, the screen stops being their only refuge.

And that’s when you’ve done more than “limit screen time.”

That’s when you’ve given your child something no algorithm ever will: the belief that they can survive real life without running from it.
