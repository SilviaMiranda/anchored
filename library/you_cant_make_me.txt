 
I was at the Sava River yesterday afternoon, trying to cool off in the water after a hot day.

There's this grassy area where families usually set up - kids splashing around in the shallows, parents keeping watch from the bank…

I'd been there about an hour when I heard a mom calling from shore:

"Miha, time to get out! We need to head home for dinner!"

This little boy, maybe 5 years old, was waist-deep in the water with some kind of foam pool noodle.

"Five more minutes!" he yelled back, not even looking at her.

"No, we said 4 o'clock, and it's already past that. Come on, out of the water!"

That's when Miha turned around with a look of pure defiance and just kept on ignoring them.

His dad waded in ankle-deep: "Miha, if you don't come out right now, no swimming for the rest of the week."

But instead of complying, he did what I would imagine was every parent’s worst nightmare at that moment…

He started screaming at the top of his lungs: "I HATE YOU! I'M NEVER GETTING OUT! NEVER NEVER NEVER!"

And then he threw his pool noodle as hard as he could - right at his dad's face.

I watched his parents' faces cycle through embarrassment, frustration, and sheer panic.

You could practically see them wondering…

Do we drag him out in front of everyone?

Do we give in to avoid making this worse?

Why is our child the one throwing a tantrum while every other kid seems perfectly behaved?

Here's what I couldn't stop thinking about...

This kid had turned a simple request into a full-scale power struggle in about 30 seconds.

And the approach his parents used - the same one 90% of us would instinctively try - was actually programming Miha's brain to have bigger, more dramatic outbursts in the future.

Tomorrow, I'll share what was really happening in Miha's developing brain during those crucial 30 seconds...

But first, I'm curious…

Put yourself in those parents' shoes for a moment.

You're standing ankle-deep in a river, your child just threw a pool noodle at your face, and dozens of strangers are watching.

What would you do?

 
Yesterday, I promised to share what was really happening in Miha's brain during those crucial 30 seconds when a simple request turned into a pool noodle flying through the air.

Here's what neuroscience tells us…

When children feel a sudden loss of control, their brain's alarm system (the amygdala) floods them with stress hormones in under 3 seconds.

This hijacks their ability to think rationally and triggers a fight-or-flight response.

And that's exactly what happened to Miha in that moment.

He wasn’t trying to control his parents.

His stressed brain was desperately searching for ANY way to feel like he had some power in a situation where he felt completely helpless.

Think about it from his perspective:

He'd been having the best day ever, completely absorbed in the cool water and whatever game he'd invented with that pool noodle.

Then suddenly, with zero warning, his entire world got flipped upside down.

"Time to get out."

In that moment, his brain went into complete panic mode.

Not because he's spoiled or defiant...

But because he realized he had absolutely zero say in what was happening to him.

You've probably seen this exact pattern in your own home:

You announce it's time to leave the park → instant resistance

You say 'put on your shoes' → suddenly they can't find them

You mention bedtime → they desperately need water/bathroom/one more story

This isn't a coincidence.

It's their developing brain's predictable response to feeling powerless.

Adults decide when he wakes up, what he eats, where he goes, when he leaves, what he wears, when he sleeps…

And now they were taking away the one perfect moment he'd had all day.

So he grabbed for the only power he could find - the power to make his own choices about his behavior.

Here's the part that most parents miss...

When we respond to this with MORE control ("You WILL get out right now or else"), we're actually confirming exactly what terrified him in the first place.

That he's completely powerless.

Which is why he escalated to throwing things and screaming…

Because it was the only way his overwhelmed brain knew how to say, "I need to feel like I have some choice in what happens to me."

His parents weren't doing anything wrong.

But they were fighting the wrong battle entirely.


 
If you've ever felt your face burn with embarrassment as your child screamed on the grocery store floor...

If you've tried everything - reasoning, bribing, threatening, ignoring - and watched the tantrum get worse instead of better...

If you've ever wondered if you're raising a tiny tyrant and what you did wrong as a parent…

Then you've probably also asked yourself the question that haunts every parent dealing with tantrums…

"Why does this keep happening? What am I missing?"

Let me tell you what I've discovered in my 40+ year career…

Most tantrums aren't random explosions of bad behavior.

They follow a predictable pattern - and once you understand this pattern, you can interrupt it before the explosion ever happens.

This requires mastering exactly THREE intervention points that work together to build genuine cooperation instead of daily battles.

I call it the 3-Step Tantrum Prevention System.

Here’s how it works:

#1 You have to respond to tantrums in a way that restores your child's sense of safety and control

When your child is screaming because you said no to candy, or because it's time to leave somewhere fun, or falling apart because their plans got changed - their emotional brain has taken over.

In those moments, they can't think clearly or respond to logic.

But here's what you CAN do...

You can respond in ways that help their nervous system settle while teaching them that big emotions are manageable.

That's why the first part of the system focuses on Co-Regulation Tools. These techniques will help your child move through tantrums without making them worse or longer.

Instead of trying to reason with them or make the tantrum stop immediately, you become their calm anchor while the emotional storm passes.

When your child consistently experiences you as steady and supportive during their most difficult moments, they learn that emotions aren't dangerous...

And this builds their confidence in their ability to handle big feelings.

#2 You need to give your child's brain the predictability it craves.

This is where most parents miss a huge opportunity...

Because the majority of tantrums happen during predictable situations: transitions, changes to routine, when children feel rushed or out of control.

Your child's developing brain craves predictability and structure. When they can't anticipate what's coming next or feel they have no say in their day, their nervous system gets activated...

Which means they become reactive and prone to power struggles over things that wouldn't normally upset them.

That's why the second part of the system focuses on Prevention Strategies - specific ways to create the structure and predictability your child needs while giving them appropriate control over their day.

Instead of every request becoming a potential battle, these strategies help your child feel secure and cooperative.

When your child knows what to expect and feels they have some influence over how things happen, power struggles become much less frequent.

#3 You build your child's tolerance for disappointment and frustration.

This is the piece most parents never address directly, but it's crucial for ending power struggles long-term.

Your child will always face moments when they can't have what they want immediately...

When they have to wait, hear "no,"or stop doing something they're enjoying...

If they haven't learned how to handle these inevitable disappointments, they'll continue having explosive reactions every time life doesn't go perfectly.

That's why the final part of the system focuses on Resilience-Building Strategies, where you’ll learn ways to gradually build your child's capacity for handling frustration without falling apart.

When your child develops this skill, they stop seeing every boundary as a personal attack.

They learn that they can want something and not get it right away - and survive the feeling.

When you get all three pieces working together, your child stops fighting you and starts working with you….

They develop the emotional intelligence that helps them navigate friendships, school challenges, and eventually workplace dynamics.

And most importantly, they grow up feeling capable and confident instead of constantly battling for control.


 
Over the weekend, my inbox exploded with messages from parents who recognised themselves in Miha's story.

And all of you were asking me the same thing…

What should his parents have done differently?

Now, I wasn’t planning on revealing any of the actual techniques from my paid challenge…

But this situation is so common that I’m going to break my own rule and share it with you today.

We've already talked about how most parents instinctively try to assert control when their child resists….

They repeat the command louder, issue consequences, or try to reason through the situation.

But that doesn't work when your child's brain is in fight-or-flight mode.

So here's the counterintuitive approach that I teach instead...

Skip trying to solve the "problem" and go straight to their feelings.

Instead of reasoning with your child, issuing consequences, or trying to make them stop...

Say something like: "You really wish you could stay in the water forever. You wish swimming time didn't have to end."

Now, I know what you might be thinking...

"Won't that just encourage them to argue more?"

In 90% of cases, the answer is no.

What most parents discover is that their child's intense emotions start settling down much faster.

Instead of escalating the fight, they often nod or take a deep breath...

And once that emotional pressure is released, they're usually willing to cooperate with leaving.

Why does this work when boundaries and logic don't?

Because you're addressing what they're REALLY upset about.

That tantrum isn't actually about defying the parents - it's about the feeling of having something they love interrupted.

When you acknowledge that deeper wish instead of fighting the surface behavior...

They feel understood at the exact moment they expect to feel controlled.

Now here's the part that makes or breaks this technique...

The exact words and tone you use matter more than you think.

Use the wrong phrasing, and you'll actually reinforce the tantrum.

Say it with even a hint of sarcasm, and they'll escalate further.

Acknowledge the wrong desire, and you'll teach them that screaming gets them what they want.

But when you get the wording right, it's remarkably effective.
